# `survML`: Tools for Flexible Survival Analysis Using Machine Learning

**Note: The current development version of `survML` now has functionality for estimating variable importance and for estimating a covariate-adjusted survival curve under current status sampling, in addition to the original survival stacking functionality that was included in versions 1.1.0 and earlier. A new version on CRAN is forthcoming.** 

The `survML` package contains a variety of functions for analyzing survival data using machine learning. These include: 

1. *Global and local survival stacking*: Use off-the-shelf machine learning tools to estimate conditional survival functions.  

2. *Algorithm-agnostic variable importance*: Use debiased machine learning to estimate and make inference on variable importance for prediction of time-to-event outcomes. 

3. *Current-status isotonic regression*: Use isotonic regression to estimate the covariate-adjusted survival function of a time-to-event outcome under current status sampling. 

See the package vignettes and function reference for more details. 


## Installing `survML`

You can install a stable version of `survML` from CRAN using

```r
install.packages("survML")
```

Alternatively, the development version of `survML` is available on GitHub. You can install it using the `devtools` package as follows: 

```r
## install.packages("devtools") # run only if necessary
install_github(repo = "cwolock/survML")
```

## Integration with `CFsurvival`

The `CFsurvival` package can be used to estimate a covariate-adjusted counterfactual survival curve from observational data. This approach requires estimating the conditional event and censoring distributions. In [this fork](https://github.com/cwolock/CFsurvival) of the `CFsurvival` package, we have added `stackG()` from `survML` as an option for estimating these nuisance parameters. 

## Documentation

Full documentation can be found on the `survML` website at [https://cwolock.github.io/survML/](https://cwolock.github.io/survML/).
